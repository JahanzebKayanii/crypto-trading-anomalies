Teaching Python to spot pump & dump schemes with volume spikes and price gymnastics

What It Does
Detects crypto market manipulation by flagging days when:

Price moves >5% AND
Volume spikes >2x normal

Quick Start
bashpip install pandas numpy matplotlib
python crypto_detector.py
How It Works

Generates fake crypto data with hidden manipulation patterns
Runs detection algorithm to find suspicious trading days
Shows results with charts highlighting red flag days

Sample Output
Found 8 suspicious trading days:

Date: 2024-01-31
  Price change: 15.2%
  Volume spike: 3.1x normal
Plus visual charts with red dots marking sketchy days.
Detection Logic
Simple but effective:
pythonsuspicious = (price_change > 5%) & (volume_spike > 2x)
Why This Works

Normal trading: Small price moves, normal volume âœ…
Manipulation: Artificial volume + big price swings ðŸš¨
