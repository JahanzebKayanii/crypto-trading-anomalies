Teaching Python to spot pump & dump schemes with volume spikes and price gymnastics

What It Does
Detects crypto market manipulation by flagging days when:

Price moves >5% AND
Volume spikes >2x normal

How It Works

Generates fake crypto data with hidden manipulation patterns
Runs detection algorithm to find suspicious trading days
Shows results with charts highlighting red flag days

Sample Output
Found 5 suspicious trading days:

Date: 2025-05-05
  Price change: -6.5%
  Volume spike: 2.6x normal
Plus visual charts with red dots marking sketchy days.
Detection Logic
Simple but effective:
pythonsuspicious = (price_change > 5%) & (volume_spike > 2x)

Why This Works

Normal trading: Small price moves, normal volume âœ…
Manipulation: Artificial volume + big price swings ðŸš¨
